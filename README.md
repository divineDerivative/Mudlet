# Mudlet
A collection of Mudlet packages for Achaea and Lusternia

## Achaea
Avast! - a seafaring package

Medic! - adapted from my Lusternia curing system of the same name, mostly useful for the chaser. Makes some use of server side curing, and the sipper might work.

Defences - captures your defences and displays them in an organized, more visual way. Also stores the state of defences to be used for scripting. Not all classes supported.

## Lusternia
Defences - same as above, but some classes may be outdated.

Influence - influencing script originally distrubted as a Windmills module

Who Package - appends the names of offplane people to cwho, hwho, and owho. House and Order triggers will need adjusted to fit your org, city/commune should work for all orgs.

Windmills 3.0 - aethercrafting package, originally created by Morbo and updated by me (Tulemrah). Should be self guiding, just lock in and follow instructions.
